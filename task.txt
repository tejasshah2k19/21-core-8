1) Take String from the user and check string is palindrome or not 
2) create a mini hangman game. 
	you need to take 1 predefine string name is "mainString" and ask user to guess that. 
	user will input single character on single attempt if his guess is 
	correct than you need to print "correct guess" 
	if his guess is wrong then u need to print "wrong guess" 
	you can give total size / 3 attempt to user for guess. size is the length of "mainString" 
	
	
	
	
randomWord => royal
india 
	worngAttm = royal.length() / 3 => 1 [0]

 inheritance:- 
 	create a class Shape with a method print() to print "this is shape".
	create two more classes named Rectangle and circle , these two class
	are inherited from Shape class. both class having a method print() to print 
	"This is Rectangle" -> Rectangle
	"This is Circle" -> Circle 
	create a subclass Square of Rectangle having a method print() to print 
	"Square is a rectangle". 
	Call method of Shape and Rectangle class using object of Square class.
