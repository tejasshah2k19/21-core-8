1) Take String from the user and check string is palindrome or not 
2) create a mini hangman game. 
	you need to take 1 predefine string name is "mainString" and ask user to guess that. 
	user will input single character on single attempt if his guess is 
	correct than you need to print "correct guess" 
	if his guess is wrong then u need to print "wrong guess" 
	you can give total size / 3 attempt to user for guess. size is the length of "mainString"
