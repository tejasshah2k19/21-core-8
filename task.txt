1) Take String from the user and check string is palindrome or not 
2) create a mini hangman game. 
	you need to take 1 predefine string name is "mainString" and ask user to guess that. 
	user will input single character on single attempt if his guess is 
	correct than you need to print "correct guess" 
	if his guess is wrong then u need to print "wrong guess" 
	you can give total size / 3 attempt to user for guess. size is the length of "mainString" 
	
	
	
	
randomWord => royal
india 
	worngAttm = royal.length() / 3 => 1 [0]
	
	enter char? 
	l
	correct Guess 
	o
	correct Guess 
	r
	correct Guess 
	x
	wrong Guess	
	y
	correct Guess 
	z
	wrong Guess	
	Game Over

Part II )
	Now once half of the correct characters identified by user then print message you decoded  half string.
	total length of string is 5  	
	Do you want to attempt entire string?1 yes 2 no 
	1
	enter string ? 
	lorem 
	Wrong guess 
	wrongAttm -> finish -> game over 
	continue 
	  
	Do you want to attempt entire string?1 yes 2 no

StringBuffer-StringBuilder 

1) Take 1 string from user and remove all the upper character from string

	1) encrypt  
	2) decrypt 
	
	1  
	e.g 
		enter your password 
		royal123 
		
		your encrypted password is 
		=>tdqfzycdnf3v4t5f
		
		=>tfqdagcgnf3h4j5k
		 
		
 	2
 		Enter your decrypted password 
 		=>tdqfzycdnf3v4t5f
		  royal123 
		  
		  	
		=>tfqdagcgnf3h4j5k
		  royal123

 inheritance:- 
 	create a class Shape with a method print() to print "this is shape".
	create two more classes named Rectangle and circle , these two class
	are inherited from Shape class. both class having a method print() to print 
	"This is Rectangle" -> Rectangle
	"This is Circle" -> Circle 
	create a subclass Square of Rectangle having a method print() to print 
	"Square is a rectangle". 
	Call method of Shape and Rectangle class using object of Square class.
